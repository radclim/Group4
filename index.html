        <h2>git clone &lt;url&gt;</h2>

        <code>git clone {url-of-the-project} {folder-in-which-to-clone}</code>

      <article>
        <h2>git status</h2>

        <code>git status</code>

        <p>
          It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and
          which files aren't being tracked by Git.

        <h2>git add .</h2>

        <code>git add .</code>

        <p>
          We've made some changes in our working directory (our project), and we
          want to include these changes in our next commit.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>git commit -m "message"</h2>

        <code>git commit -m "message"</code>

        <p>
          We've made some progress in our project, and we want to save our
          project in this exact state, sort of like a backup.
        </p>

      <article>
        <h2>git push</h2>

        <code>git push -u {remote-name} {branch}</code>

        <p>
          We want to be sure that the commits we've made, won't be lost. We want
          to be able to access the project from multiple computers. We want to
          be able to collaborate with other people on a project.
        </p>

      <article>
        <h2>git pull</h2>
        <code>git pull {remote-name} {branch-name}</code>
        <p>

          repository.
